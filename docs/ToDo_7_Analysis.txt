# Dockerfile
The Dockerfile file is used to build a Docker image for Eclipse Mosquitto MQTT Broker.
From its code we can see that it uses the Alpine Linux base image.
I asume it install several dependencies from source, as well as downloading and compiling libwebsockets and Mosquitto from source.
At the end, the code does 2 main tasks:
 - Creating the mosquitto user and group, setting up necessary directories, and installs compiled binaries.
 - Configuring the entry point script, exposing port 1883, and seting the default command.

# docker-entrypoint.sh
This is a shell script executed as the entry point when the Docker container starts.
Its actions are setting  permissions for the mosquitto directory if the script is run as the root user, and executing the passed command or arguments.
